# Data-Analysis
This repository aims to compile various pipelines and scripts I have developed for the analysis of biological data, with a particular focus on genomics and transcriptomics. It includes customized workflows covering tasks from raw data preprocessing to differential analysis and visualization, applied to techniques such as ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and RIP-seq, among others.
